Space Apps Ottawa 2017 Bird Watcher Project

This is the frontend for an app that allows users to take pictures of birds and upload them to a server, which uses machine learning algorithms to identify the species of bird. Users can also view the locations of other bird pictures stored on the server.

This project was selected as one of the two Ottawa nominees for NASA Space Apps Competition.

The backend can be found at:
